This is my first major Python Project. It uses classes and lists to provide the user with a working game of BattleShip. It will first ask you where to place the ship, and you say the coordinates, 
for example "0,0" or "3,2", all the way up to 5. Then you type "v" or "h" if you want the ship to vertical or horizontal.

After all the ships are placed for both players, you start guessing the coordinates of your opponents ship just like regular BattleShip. First player to sink all the ships wins!
